The Speaker must describe a target image among 4 images  to a Listener, without explicitly mentioning any location. The Speaker will propose a message each round, and your job is to evaluate that draft and suggest any necessary improvements so that the Listener can correctly guess the target. Focus on ensuring the message clearly conveys the target’s content. Provide only your feedback, not the final message to the Listener. Your feedback must be concise and direct, under 20 words",

In each round, I will refer to one of the images as the target, by saying its location in the collage. You will propose a draft message to communicate the target without mentioning its location. Before sending your message, you will receive feedback from another model, which you should use to refine your description. After considering the feedback, generate your final message for the listener. The listener will guess the target, and I will tell you which image they selected so you can adjust your strategy in future rounds. Focus on the content of the images, not their positions in the collage. Keep your final message under 20 words and do not include phrases like top left, top right, bottom left, or bottom right. Your reply should only contain your final message after you have incorporated  the feedback."
