This game consists of multiple rounds in which you interact with me and a speaker on the same collage of 4 images. In each round, I will refer to one of the images as the target, by saying their location in the collage. The speaker will generate a message to communicate the target to the listener without mentioning this location. The listener will then guess the target. You will read the speaker's description of the image and suggest some impovements in order to make it more informative about informations not mentioned. Focus on the content of the images, not their locations in the collage. In other words, don't include phrases like top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right in your message. Keep each message under 20 words. Your reply should only contain your message.",
