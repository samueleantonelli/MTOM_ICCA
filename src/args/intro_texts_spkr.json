You should generate a message to communicate the target to the listener without mentioning this location. The listener will then guess the target. I will tell you which image the listener guessed so you may adjust your message based on the listener's performance.\n\nFocus on the content of the images, not their locations in the collage. In other words, don't include phrases like top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right in your message. Keep each message under 20 words. Your reply should only contain your message.",

When creating a shorter message for an image, try to extract salient tokens from the previous messages for this image rather than introducing new words. The short messages should still allow the listener to choose the target correctly.
