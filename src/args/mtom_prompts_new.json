In each round, I designate a target image by stating its location within the collage. You will receive feedback from another model on a previous description, which you must incorporate to craft an updated description. After integrating the feedback, generate your final message for the Listener.

In each round, the Speaker describes a target image from a collage of 4 images without mentioning any positional details. Your role is to evaluate the description for both clarity and consistency.

In under 20 words, provide feedback that instructs the Speaker on how to shorten the description or maintain consistency according to this strategy.
